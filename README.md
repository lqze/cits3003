[Part 1 specification](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/labsheet.php?fname=project-2016-home/project-part1)  
[Part 2 specification](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/labsheet.php?fname=project-2016-home/project-part2)


###Summary
The CITS3003 project consists of two parts: part 1 is worth 25% and part 2 is worth 15%. As the additional functionalities in part 2 of the project are actually an extension of the same C++ code from part 1, you only need to submit the final C++ code at the end of part 2 of the project. However, you can use cssubmit as a backup storage for the code that you develop during the project weeks.

###Groups
You should complete this project in groups of two. Each individual is also required to separately write their own report and to separately design and implement their own small extension of the specified functionalities.

###Submission
You should submit all your files to cssubmit. To submit your files, you will need to login to the system using your Pheme account.
- You do not need to submit the header (.h), base C code (.c), shared or dynamic library (.so or .dylib) files given to you. However, if you made any changes to these files then you should include them in your submission. To ensure that your program works when we test it, **you should submit a zip file that retains the directory structure of the program.** Note: ***your scene editor will be tested on computers that are compatible to those in the labs.***
- For the report mentioned below, it should be in PDF format. Please mention your full name, student number, and group number on the first page of the report. Please name your report file as report1-xyz.pdf where xyz should be replaced by your surname.

If your group size is 1, the submission process is straightforward. If your group size is 2, then one of the group members must be responsible for submitting the code. Both group members should submit their individual reports where their individual effort on the coding should be detailed. The individual code would be tested and marked separately. For instance, if student A is responsble for functionalities 1, 3, and 4 while student B is responsible for implementing functionalities 2, 5, and 6, then student A would receive a lower mark if functionalities 3 and 4 are not working properly but functionalities 2, 5, and 6 all work fine.
